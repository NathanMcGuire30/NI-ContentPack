If you're reading this, thanks for actually reading it!

All models, items, graphics and parts built by me. 
If you would like to make suggestions or report bugs, do so on my main thread.


Please do not in any way, attempt to steal my work. Doing so will result in polite request. Or otherwise, threat of low legal action.
(Most of the 300+ files actually have my name written on it, and some .class files forever having my name in it.)



Permissions for use:
--------------------
You are allowed to use my pack for your personal, or private/public use in a server. Distribution of my pack must be complete, with all files.

The only modifications that can be made to the pack, are item names and the stats of the guns. You can also add/make additional skins for the guns to your pleasure.
- Attachments and item parts should not be changed. Removing weapons and adding them to another pack is not allowed either.

Items/weapons can be disabled depending on the limitations you require for your server.
